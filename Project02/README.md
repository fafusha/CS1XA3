## Overview
 This webpage is Dennis Raoport's custom CV. The outline and content are based on the given examples in the assigment.
 I didn't use any template for my CV. I've implemented this website using the Bootsrap framework and JQuerry. 
 
## Custom Javascript Code

### Drop down Sections

In order to avoid cluttering the main content of the CV is dived into four sections as follows: Education, Extracurricular Activities, Projects and More Info. Contenet of these sections is contained within dropdown panels, which can be toggled by clicking the title.

Extra details about Technical Skills are also contined within dorpdown panels. In order to access them click the language of interest. Note that not all languages contain extra details.

This feature was implemented with JQuerry.
